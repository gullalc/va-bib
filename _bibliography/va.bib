  abstract = {Finding a suitable open access journal to publish academic work is a complex task: Researchers have to navigate a constantly growing number of journals, institutional agreements with publishers, funders’ conditions and the risk of predatory publishers. To help with these challenges, we introduce a web-based journal recommendation system called B!SON. A systematic requirements analysis was conducted in the form of a survey. The developed tool suggests open access journals based on title, abstract and references provided by the user. The recommendations are built on open data, publisher-independent and work across domains and languages. Transparency is provided by its open source nature, an open application programming interface (API) and by specifying which matches the shown recommendations are based on. The recommendation quality has been evaluated using two different evaluation techniques, including several new recommendation methods. We were able to improve the results from our previous paper with a pre-trained transformer model. The beta version of the tool received positive feedback from the community and in several test sessions. We developed a recommendation system for open access journals to help researchers find a suitable journal. The open tool has been extensively tested, and we found possible improvements for our current recommendation technique. Development by two German academic libraries ensures the longevity and sustainability of the system.},

  abstract = {The automatic semantic structuring of scientific text allows for more efficient reading of research articles and is an important indexing step for academic search engines. Sequential sentence classification is an essential structuring task and targets the categorisation of sentences based on their content and context. However, the potential of transfer learning for sentence classification across different scientific domains and text types, such as full papers and abstracts, has not yet been explored in prior work. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of transfer learning for scientific sequential sentence classification. For this purpose, we derive seven research questions and present several contributions to address them: (1) We suggest a novel uniform deep learning architecture and multi-task learning for cross-domain sequential sentence classification in scientific text. (2) We tailor two transfer learning methods to deal with the given task, namely sequential transfer learning and multi-task learning. (3) We compare the results of the two best models using qualitative examples in a case study. (4) We provide an approach for the semi-automatic identification of semantically related classes across annotation schemes and analyse the results for four annotation schemes. The clusters and underlying semantic vectors are validated using k-means clustering. (5) Our comprehensive experimental results indicate that when using the proposed multi-task learning architecture, models trained on datasets from different scientific domains benefit from one another. Our approach significantly outperforms state of the art on full paper datasets while being on par for datasets consisting of abstracts.},

  abstract = {In the context of inclusive education, Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a framework used worldwide to create learning opportunities accessible to all learners. While much research focused on the design and students' perceptions of UDL-based learning settings, studies on students’ usage patterns in UDL-guided elements, particularly in digital environments, are still scarce. Therefore, we analyze and cluster the usage patterns of 9th and 10th graders in a web-based learning platform called I3Learn. The platform focuses on chemistry learning, and UDL principles guide its design. We collected the temporal usage patterns of UDL-guided elements of 384 learners in detailed log files. The collected data includes the time spent using video and/or text as a source of information, working on learning tasks with or without help and working on self-assessments. We used Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to identify relevant factors in the observed usage behaviors. Based on the factor loadings, we extracted features for k-means clustering and named the resulting groups based on their usage patterns and learner characteristics. The EFA revealed four factors suggesting that learners remain consistent in selecting UDL-guided elements that require a decision (video or text, tasks with or without help). Based on these four factors, the cluster analysis identifies six different groups. We discuss these results as a starting point to provide individualized learning support through further artificial intelligence applications and inform educators about learner activity through a dashboard.},
